## Description

Build the Calendar Setup module in the Admin Panel. Fetch Plato calendar data from `GET /systemsetup` via the proxy layer, store calendar color IDs in the `plato_calendars` table, and provide a UI to map each doctor to their corresponding Plato calendar color ID. This mapping is required for POST /appointment/slots to check availability per doctor's calendar. Per v2-decisions.md Process 2 Step 6 and Process 5 Step 1 prerequisite.

---

## Context

- `docs/v2-decisions.md` — Process 2, Step 6: "GET /systemsetup sync — Calendar Setup UI — map doctor to Plato calendar color ID"
- `docs/v2-decisions.md` — Process 5, Step 1: "Prerequisite: Process 2 step 6 complete (Calendar Setup in Admin Panel)"
- `docs/api-guidelines.md` — "5. API Temujanji (Appointments)" — calendar color IDs from `GET /systemsetup`, `POST /appointment/slots` with `check_for_conflicts` array
- `laravel/app/Models/PlatoCalendar.php` — created in P2-T02
- `laravel/app/Models/Doctor.php` — created in P2-T02, with CRUD in P2-T04

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- Create `CalendarSetupController` with:
  - Index: list all doctor-to-calendar mappings
  - Sync: fetch calendars from Plato via `GET /systemsetup` through proxy
  - Map: associate a doctor with one or more Plato calendar color IDs
  - Unmap: remove doctor-calendar association
- Blade views: calendar setup index (table showing doctor, calendar name, calendar color ID, active status), sync button, map form
- Integration with Plato proxy: use the Laravel proxy's internal HTTP client to call Plato's `GET /systemsetup` (not going through the public proxy endpoint)
- Parse `GET /systemsetup` response to extract calendar entries (each with color ID, name, etc.)
- Store synced calendars in `plato_calendars` table linked to doctors
- Toggle calendar active/inactive per doctor
- Sync button on index page: triggers Plato fetch, updates calendar list
- Flash success/error messages
- Admin sidebar navigation link

### Out of Scope
- Creating appointments (Process 5 Step 7 and Process 7)
- Modifying Plato calendars (read-only from Plato)
- Syncing other system setup data (just calendars)

---

## Technical Spec

### Files to Create or Modify
- `laravel/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CalendarSetupController.php` — sync and manage calendar mappings
- `laravel/app/Services/PlatoSystemSetupService.php` — service to fetch and parse Plato systemsetup data
- `laravel/resources/views/admin/calendar-setup/index.blade.php` — calendar mapping list
- `laravel/resources/views/admin/calendar-setup/map.blade.php` — map doctor to calendar form
- `laravel/resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php` — add Calendar Setup to sidebar
- `laravel/routes/web.php` — add calendar setup routes (GET index, POST sync, POST map, DELETE unmap)

### API Endpoints (Internal)
- `GET /systemsetup` (Plato API, called internally via Laravel HTTP client) — returns calendar data
  - Response contains calendar entries with: `color` (ID), `name`, `doctor`, etc.

### Data / Schema
- `plato_calendars` table (created in P2-T02): id, doctor_id, plato_calendar_color_id, name, is_active
- Calendar data from Plato `GET /systemsetup` response:
  - `color`: the unique calendar color ID (used in `check_for_conflicts` for POST /appointment/slots)
  - `name`: calendar/doctor name from Plato
  - Additional fields: doctor mapping, facility info

### UI Components (Admin Panel — Blade)
- Index table: Doctor name, Calendar name, Plato Color ID, Active status, Actions (Edit Map, Delete)
- Sync button: large button at top "Sync Calendars from Plato" — triggers fetch and updates or inserts records
- Map form: doctor dropdown (from doctors table), calendar selection (from synced calendars), active toggle
- Last synced timestamp shown on index page
- Loading indicator during sync
- Empty state: "No calendars synced yet. Click Sync to fetch from Plato."

### Constraints
- Calendar sync must NOT create duplicate entries — upsert by plato_calendar_color_id + doctor_id
- Calendar color ID must be stored exactly as returned from Plato (string format)
- Doctors without calendar mappings should show a warning on the index
- Sync endpoint must be POST (not GET) to prevent CSRF/accidental triggering

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Calendar Setup index page loads showing all doctor-calendar mappings with doctor name, calendar name, color ID, and active status
- [ ] "Sync Calendars from Plato" button fetches `GET /systemsetup` from Plato via internal proxy, parses response, and stores/updates calendar entries
- [ ] Synced calendars are stored in `plato_calendars` table with correct plato_calendar_color_id
- [ ] Admin can map a doctor to one or more synced calendar color IDs with active/inactive toggle
- [ ] Admin can unmap (delete) a doctor-calendar association
- [ ] Calendar Setup link appears in admin sidebar navigation
- [ ] Duplicate calendar entries are not created on repeated sync (upsert behavior)
- [ ] Last sync timestamp is displayed on the index page
- [ ] Flash success/error messages appear after sync and map operations

## Implementation Notes

> Filled in by the Developer after implementation.

### What Was Done
- Created `PlatoSystemSetupService` — fetches and parses calendar entries from `GET /systemsetup` via `PlatoProxyService`
- Created `CalendarSetupController` with full resource CRUD + sync endpoint (POST /admin/calendars/sync)
- Created Form Requests: `StorePlatoCalendarRequest`, `UpdatePlatoCalendarRequest`
- Created 4 Blade views: index (with sync card, search/filter, table, unmapped doctor warning, empty state), create (map doctor to calendar), edit, show
- Added migration to make `doctor_id` nullable on `plato_calendars` table (required for unlinked synced calendars)
- Added routes: `Route::resource('calendars', CalendarSetupController::class)` + explicit `POST calendars/sync` before resource
- Updated admin sidebar: replaced disabled "Calendar Setup (Soon)" placeholder with active navigation link
- Sync stores parsed calendar entries in `plato_calendars` with `doctor_id = null`, then admin maps to doctors via create form
- Last sync timestamp stored in `settings` table via `Setting` model
- Unmapped doctor warning shown on index when active doctors have no calendar mapping
- Duplicate prevention: sync upserts by `plato_calendar_color_id` + `doctor_id IS NULL`

### Files Changed
- `laravel/app/Services/PlatoSystemSetupService.php` — NEW
- `laravel/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CalendarSetupController.php` — NEW
- `laravel/app/Http/Requests/StorePlatoCalendarRequest.php` — NEW
- `laravel/app/Http/Requests/UpdatePlatoCalendarRequest.php` — NEW
- `laravel/database/migrations/2026_07_05_000007_make_doctor_id_nullable_on_plato_calendars.php` — NEW
- `laravel/resources/views/admin/calendars/index.blade.php` — NEW
- `laravel/resources/views/admin/calendars/create.blade.php` — NEW
- `laravel/resources/views/admin/calendars/edit.blade.php` — NEW
- `laravel/resources/views/admin/calendars/show.blade.php` — NEW
- `laravel/routes/web.php` — MODIFIED (added CalendarSetupController import and routes)
- `laravel/resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php` — MODIFIED (Calendar Setup sidebar link)

### Decisions Made During Implementation
- Made `doctor_id` nullable on `plato_calendars` table via migration — required because sync from Plato creates entries not yet mapped to any doctor
- Sync stores calendars with `doctor_id = null`; admin uses "Map Calendar" form to link to a doctor
- Duplicate prevention: checks by `plato_calendar_color_id` + `doctor_id IS NULL` for synced entries
- Calendars that no longer exist in Plato are set to `is_active = false` (not deleted)
- Sync results are flashed to session for display in the "Available Plato Calendars" panel on index page

### Known Limitations
- Calendar sync depends on `PlatoProxyService` which requires valid `PLATO_API_TOKEN` in .env — if not configured, sync will fail with 401
- The systemsetup endpoint response format may vary; the parser handles `data.calendar`, `data.calendars` arrays and recursively searches for calendar entries
- No auto-mapping by doctor name match — admin must manually map each calendar to the correct doctor

### Result: PASSED

### Criteria Results
- [x] Index page loads — PASS (table shows doctor name, calendar name, color ID in code tag, active/inactive badge; includes search, doctor filter, status filter, sort, pagination, empty state with Sync CTA)
- [x] Sync from Plato works — PASS (POST /admin/calendars/sync calls PlatoSystemSetupService which proxies GET /systemsetup via PlatoProxyService; parsed calendar entries upserted into plato_calendars)
- [x] Calendar entries stored — PASS (upsert by plato_calendar_color_id + doctor_id IS NULL; stores name and is_active; deactivates entries not in current sync)
- [x] Doctor-calendar mapping — PASS (create form with doctor dropdown + color ID input + name input + active toggle; edit form with same fields; store/update with validation)
- [x] Unmapping works — PASS (destroy method deletes PlatoCalendar record; delete button on index with JS confirm dialog)
- [x] Sidebar navigation — PASS (admin.blade.php updated: disabled placeholder replaced with active route link using routeIs('admin.calendars.*'))
- [x] Duplicate prevention — PASS (sync queries existing entry by plato_calendar_color_id + null doctor_id before insert; updates existing, creates only if not found)
- [x] Last sync timestamp — PASS (stored in settings table via Setting::updateOrCreate; displayed on index via Carbon formatting)
- [x] Success/error messages — PASS (admin layout renders session('success') green and session('error') red banners; all actions return flash messages)

### Failure Details
