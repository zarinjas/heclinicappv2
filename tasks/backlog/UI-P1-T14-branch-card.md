## Description

Build the `BranchCard` reusable component for branch selection in the Booking flow (Step 1). Displays branch name, address, operating hours, and distance. Shows accent border when selected.

---

## Context

- `docs/ui-design-system.md` — §10 (Cards — Base Card)
- `docs/ui-migration-plan.md` — Phase 1, §1.14 (BranchCard), Phase 4 (Booking Flow — Step 1 Branch)
- `docs/ui-epic.md` — Phase 1 compliance rules
- `docs/design-system-v2.png` — visual target

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- `lib/core/widgets/branch_card.dart` — new file
- Branch name: `heading3` style
- Address: `body2`, `textSecondary`, with location pin icon
- Operating hours: `body2`, `textSecondary`, with clock icon
- Distance: `body2`, `textSecondary` (right-aligned or trailing)
- Selection state: 1.5px accent border, slight accent-tinted background
- Unselected state: standard card border (`#E5E7EB`), surface background
- Tap callback for selection
- Skeleton loader: card rect with 3 text bars

### Out of Scope
- Branch data fetching (data passed via constructor)
- Multi-select logic (handled by parent)
- Branch detail navigation (separate screen)

---

## Technical Spec

### Files to Create or Modify
- `lib/core/widgets/branch_card.dart` — new file

### Design Spec
- Uses base AppCard styling (radiusLG, shadowLow, padding md)
- Selected: accent border 1.5px, slight accent bg tint
- Unselected: divider border 1px
- Name: heading3, primary
- Address/operating hours: body2, textSecondary, with leading icons

### Constraints
- Design tokens only
- Dark mode support
- Skeleton loader defined

---
