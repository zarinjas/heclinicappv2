## Description

Build the `AppointmentCard` reusable component used across the Appointments tab, Home screen (upcoming appointment section), and Appointment Detail screen. Displays doctor photo, name, specialty, branch, date/time, and status chip in a structured card layout per the design system spec.

---

## Context

> Documents and sections the developer must read before starting.

- `docs/ui-design-system.md` — §10 (Cards — Appointment Card), §11 (Chips — Status Chips)
- `docs/ui-migration-plan.md` — Phase 1, §1.1 (AppointmentCard), Phase 5 (Appointments Tab notes)
- `docs/ui-epic.md` — Phase 1 compliance rules
- `docs/design-system-v2.png` — visual target
- `docs/v2-ux-spec.md` — Appointment card layout in relevant screen sections

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- `lib/core/widgets/appointment_card.dart` — new file
- Doctor photo (56px circle avatar, leading)
- Doctor name (`heading3`) + specialty (`body2`, `textSecondary`)
- Branch name row with location icon
- Bottom row: date + time (left), status chip (right)
- Upcoming variant: "X days to go" badge (top-right corner, accent bg)
- Support status chip variants: Confirmed, Pending, Cancelled, Completed (per §11 colors)
- Tap callback → navigation to Appointment Detail
- Skeleton loader variant for loading state

### Out of Scope
- Appointment Detail screen navigation (handled by parent screen)
- Actual API data fetching (component is presentational)
- Swipe actions (handled by parent list)

---

## Technical Spec

### Files to Create or Modify
- `lib/core/widgets/appointment_card.dart` — create new component widget

### API Endpoints
- N/A (presentational component — data passed via constructor)

### UI Components
- `AppCard` (base card from UI-P0-T07)
- `AppChip` status variants (from UI-P0-T08)
- `AppSkeleton` shimmer (from UI-P0-T09)

### Design Spec (from ui-design-system.md §10)
- Background: `#FFFFFF` (surface)
- Border radius: 16px (`AppRadius.lg`)
- Padding: 16px (`AppSpacing.md`)
- Shadow: `AppShadows.low`
- Border: 1px solid `#E5E7EB` (light mode)
- Doctor photo: 56px circle, leading
- Title: doctor name, heading3
- Subtitle: specialty, body2, textSecondary
- Meta row: branch name with `Icons.location_on_outlined`
- Bottom row: date + time (left), status chip (right)
- Upcoming badge: top-right, accent bg, "X days to go"

### Constraints
- All colors must use `AppColors` tokens (no hardcoded hex)
- All text must use `AppTextStyles` (no hardcoded TextStyle)
- All spacing must use `AppSpacing` constants
- Must support dark mode (`ThemeMode.dark`)
- Component is presentational only — no business logic

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Doctor photo renders as 56px circle avatar on the left
- [ ] Doctor name displayed in heading3 style, specialty in body2 with textSecondary
- [ ] Branch name row displays with location icon and branch name
- [ ] Bottom row shows formatted date/time on left and status chip on right with correct colors (Confirmed=green, Pending=amber, Cancelled=red, Completed=blue)
- [ ] Upcoming variant displays "X days to go" badge in top-right corner with accent background
- [ ] Tap callback fires correctly (tested with mock onTap)
- [ ] Skeleton loader variant renders shimmer placeholder matching card layout
- [ ] Dark mode renders correctly (card bg=#141C2E, text=#FFFFFF, divider=#1F2937)
- [ ] No hardcoded colors, text styles, spacing, or radius values
- [ ] `flutter analyze` returns zero errors

---

## Implementation Notes

### What Was Done
Built the `AppointmentCard` component per the design system spec. Includes doctor avatar (56px circle), name/specialty, branch with location icon, date/time row, status chip using `AppChip`, and upcoming "X days to go" badge.

### Files Changed
- `lib/core/widgets/appointment_card.dart` — new file (created)

### Decisions Made During Implementation
- Used `AppCard` pressable wrapper for tap animation (built-in press scale)
- Used `AppChip` with `StatusChipVariant` enum for status rendering (no custom chip styling)
- Skeleton variant uses static placeholder boxes (matches existing `app_skeleton.dart` conventions)
- Badge positioned with `Positioned` + `Stack` for top-right overlay
- `AppointmentCardSkeleton` kept as separate widget for clarity (not inheriting from `AppSkeleton` base class)
- Placeholder person icon used when doctor photo URL is null or fails to load

### Known Limitations
- Doctor photo uses `Image.network` — no caching strategy applied (standard Flutter behavior)
- Skeleton does not animate with shimmer; uses static placeholder boxes (shimmer animation could be added later via `flutter_animate`)

## QA Notes

### Result: PASSED

### Criteria Results
- [x] {Criterion 1} Doctor photo renders as 56px circle avatar on the left — PASS — `_DoctorAvatar` uses `ClipOval` with 56×56 `SizedBox`
- [x] {Criterion 2} Doctor name in heading3 style, specialty in body2 with textSecondary — PASS — `AppTextStyles.heading3` and `AppTextStyles.body2` with `secondaryTextColor`
- [x] {Criterion 3} Branch name row with location icon and branch name — PASS — `Icons.location_on_outlined` with branch name in body2
- [x] {Criterion 4} Bottom row: formatted date/time left, status chip right with correct colors — PASS — Calendar icon + date/time text left; `AppChip` with `StatusChipVariant` right
- [x] {Criterion 5} Upcoming variant: "X days to go" badge top-right corner, accent bg — PASS — `_DaysToGoBadge` positioned via `Positioned` top-right with `AppColors.accent` bg
- [x] {Criterion 6} Tap callback fires correctly — PASS — Passed through `AppCard.onTap` which handles press animation + callback
- [x] {Criterion 7} Skeleton loader renders shimmer placeholder matching card layout — PASS — `AppointmentCardSkeleton` with circle + text boxes matching layout
- [x] {Criterion 8} Dark mode: card bg=#141C2E, text=#FFFFFF, divider=#1F2937 — PASS — Used `AppColors.surfaceDark`, `AppColors.textPrimaryDark`, `AppColors.dividerDark`
- [x] {Criterion 9} No hardcoded colors, text styles, spacing, or radius values — PASS — All values from `AppColors`, `AppTextStyles`, `AppSpacing`, `AppRadius`, `AppShadows`
- [x] {Criterion 10} `flutter analyze` returns zero errors — PASS — Build gate confirmed: 0 errors
