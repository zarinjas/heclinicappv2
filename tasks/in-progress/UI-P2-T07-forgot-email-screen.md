## Description

Migrate the existing forgot password step 1 from `auth_page/forgot*/` to a new V2 design-compliant screen at `lib/features/auth/forgot_email_screen.dart`. User enters email/phone to receive OTP. Replace all FlutterFlow widgets with design system components.

---

## Context

> Documents and sections the developer must read before starting.

- `docs/ui-migration-plan.md` — Phase 2 Auth Screens, Step 2.7
- `docs/ui-design-system.md` — §2 AppColors, §3 AppTextStyles, §8 AppButton, §9 AppInput, §4 AppSpacing
- `docs/ui-epic.md` — Compliance rules
- `docs/v2-ux-spec.md` — §4 Auth Flow

## Scope

> Exact deliverables for this task. Be specific.

### In Scope
- Create `lib/features/auth/forgot_email_screen.dart`
- AppBar with back button (using AppAppBar sub-page variant)
- Title: "Forgot Password" with subtitle explaining OTP will be sent
- Email/Phone input using `AppInput`
- Send OTP button using `AppButton` primary → calls send OTP API → navigate to step 2
- Form validation (valid email or phone)
- All design token usage
- Dark mode support
- Skeleton: N/A
- Empty: N/A
- Error: AppErrorState for API failure (user not found, network error)

### Out of Scope
- Forgot password steps 2 and 3 (UI-P2-T08, UI-P2-T09)
- OTP send API logic changes (preserve existing)
- Deleting old `auth_page/forgot*/` (Phase 13)

---

## Technical Spec

> Key implementation details.

### Files to Create or Modify
- `lib/features/auth/forgot_email_screen.dart` — New forgot password step 1 screen

### API Endpoints
- Existing forgot password / send OTP API (preserved from current auth_page)

### Data / Schema
- Forgot step 1: email or phone identifier

### UI Components (Flutter tasks only)
- AppAppBar: sub-page variant with back button
- AppInput: Email/Phone field
- AppButton: Primary variant for Send OTP
- Loading: Button loading state during API call
- Empty: N/A
- Error: AppErrorState for send OTP failures

### Constraints
- Must use `AppInput` for text field
- Must use `AppButton` for Send OTP (no `FFButtonWidget`)
- Must preserve existing OTP send API logic
- All colors from `AppColors`, all text from `AppTextStyles`

---

## Acceptance Criteria
