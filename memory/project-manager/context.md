## Agentic AI Setup

- Laravel proxy controller: `laravel/app/Http/Controllers/Api/PlatoProxyController.php`
- VPS bot server: `/var/www/heclinic-bot/` (PM2)

## Notes
Process 6 tasks have a linear dependency chain:
P6-T01 (scaffold) → P6-T02 (records) → P6-T03 (vitals) → P6-T04 (documents) → P6-T05 (pagination).

All Health tab data is sourced from Plato via the Laravel proxy. The existing ReportsWidget at `lib/front_page/reports/reports_widget.dart` is the target for all P6 changes. The Health tab is already registered at nav index 2 in `lib/main.dart:231` with `'health': ReportsWidget(id: null)`.
